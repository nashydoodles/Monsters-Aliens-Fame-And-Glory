GRASSY FIELD
  You awaken in a grassy field surrounded by mountains. You have no idea who you are or how you got here

  There looks to be a mineshaft far off into the distance, tunneling into one of the mountains, to the west. There is also a creepy old looking log cabin to the south east and a forest to the north.
