Descriptions:

mineshaft_entrance:

CAVE
  You stand at the entrance to the mineshaft. All you can see is darkness, and you smell the strong stench of sulfur emanating from the cave.



cavepart1:

CAVE
  You are now in the pitch black cave. You are surrounded by darkness, but there is a faint light coming from down the tunnel. The smell of sulfur has gotten stronger although there is now a new stench, it smells of decaying meat. If you decide to go further into the tunnel, go west.



cavepart2:

-beento["cavepart2"] = 0
CAVE
  As you continue further into the cave the potent smells continue to get stronger and stronger, however the light at the end of the tunnel proceeds to grow brighter. Eventually you come to a branching split in the cave where there are two tunnels, one to the left and one to the right.

  You at this moment notice the left tunnel has a purple portal like barrier. On the other side through the portal everything is blocky. Almost as if your mind has lost the ability to perceive slopes, spheres or angles. You can also see there are block like torches pinned to the side of the cave walls on the other side of the portal.

  The right tunnel is pitch black. There is an imp minding his own business facing the right wall blocking the path down that tunnel. He seems to be scratching a metal spoon against the wall and muttering something inaudible from where you are.

  The right tunnel is still pitch black. The imp is minding his own business facing the right wall blocking that path.
